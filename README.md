# Gamatrix-cli

A CLI tool that helps people compare game lists to decide what can be played in a LAN/WAN
gaming party together.

A command-line tool to compare the games owned by several users, and list
all the games they have in common. It requires all users to
use [GOG Galaxy](https://www.gog.com/galaxy); since GOG Galaxy
supports almost all major digital distribution platforms. This is the cli
version of [gamatrix](https://github.com/eniklas/gamatrix).
